# Week 2
Welcome to Week 2! We will now explore Given-Clause Algorithm, Set of Support (SOS),
Subsumption, Weighting & clause selection. Below are the recommended resources, but please feel free to tinker with these outside the scope of these.

## Recommended Resources

### **Read / Watch**
> ### Given-Clause Algorithm

- Explanation with examples (Otter-style provers):  
  http://www.lcc.uma.es/~eva/asignaturas/lic/apuntes/otter3_manual.pdf

- This paper gave the underlying logic for the algorithm

> ### Set of Support (SOS) Strategy

- The following notes contain a section on SoS strategy, but feel free to check out the other sections as well!

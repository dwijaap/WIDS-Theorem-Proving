# WiDS5.0_Theorem_Proving

This project is about understanding foundational concepts and problem-solving techniques in Automated reasoning and their application in the real world by using AI to code these proof techniques.

## Week 1
I understood the basics of logic in computer science which includes propositional logic and the undecidable nature of checking satisfiability of a formula. I implemented the algorithms to convert a given propositional logic formula to its CNF form, the DPLL algorithm to check whether a given CNF formula is satisfiable or not and giving the satisfying assignment for it. I also implemented the Robinson Algorithm for First Order Logic Formulas which helps us tell whether a first order logic formula is unsatisfiable. If no unsatisfying assignment is found for the formula in the given time limit, it outputs timed out.

## Week 2
I read and learned about Given-Clause Algorithm, Set of Support (SoS), Subsumption, Weighting & clause selection.
